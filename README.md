This is an Ecommerce app. The API is built with Miscrosoft .NET 6. The project uses stored procedures implementation - I chose this over Entity framework core due to 
the architecure I want to use and there are a good number of other reasons I am using stored procedures.
The database used in this project is Postgresql. I have included the database tables and stored procedures scripts needed to run this project.

The client app is built with React and TypeScript
